- **Date Range**: Ready for implementation (today, this week, last 30 days, custom)

## üöÄ How to Use

### Dashboard Integration

The Activity Feed is now available as a tab in the dashboard navigation for all applicable user roles:

1. **Executive**: Can access "Activity Feed" tab showing all project activities
2. **Project Executive**: Can access "Activity Feed" tab showing activities from 6 projects
3. **Project Manager**: Can access "Activity Feed" tab showing activities from 1 assigned project
4. **Estimator**: Can access "Activity Feed" tab showing empty state with message

### Project Page Integration

To use the Activity Feed in individual project pages:

```tsx
import { ProjectSpecificActivityFeed } from "@/components/feed/ProjectSpecificActivityFeed"

export default function ProjectPage({ params }: { params: { projectId: string } }) {
  const projectId = parseInt(params.projectId)
  const userRole = "project-manager" // From auth context

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-6">
      <ProjectSpecificActivityFeed projectId={projectId} userRole={userRole} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
