## Remaining Issues (Build Blockers)

### 🔴 Critical Build Failures

1. **TypeScript Type Errors** (50+ instances)

   - `Unexpected any. Specify a different type`
   - `Missing return type on function`
   - `Property comes from index signature`

2. **ESLint Violations** (100+ instances)

   - `Prefer using nullish coalescing operator`
   - `Empty components are self-closing`
   - `Visible, non-interactive elements with click handlers must have keyboard listeners`

3. **React Hooks Issues** (20+ instances)
   - `React Hook useMemo has unnecessary dependency`
   - `React Hook useCallback has spread element in dependency array`

### 🟡 Accessibility Issues

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Missing keyboard event listeners on clickable elements
2. **Auto-focus**: Inappropriate use of autoFocus prop
3. **Screen Reader**: Missing content in anchor tags

### 🟡 Performance Issues

1. **Console Statements**: Unexpected console.log statements in production code
2. **Unused Variables**: Variables assigned but never used
3. **Array Index Keys**: Using array indices as React keys

## Refactoring Summary

### ✅ Completed Refactoring

1. **Error Boundary Architecture**

   ```typescript
   // Before: Class component in server context
   <ErrorBoundary>

   // After: Client wrapper component
   <ClientErrorBoundary>
   ```

   }
   .desktop-optimized {
     /* desktop styles */
   }
   ```

3. **Type Safety Improvements**

   ```typescript
   // Before: Unsafe nullish coalescing
   const value = data?.property || "default"

   // After: Safe nullish coalescing
   const value = data?.property ?? "default"
   ```

4. **Mobile Detection Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced mobile detection with granular breakpoints
   const isMobileDevice = width < 768 || (width < 1024 && height < 768)
   ```
