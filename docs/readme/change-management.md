# Change Management Module Documentation

## Overview

The Change Management module provides comprehensive tracking and analysis of change orders, potential change orders (PCOs), prime contract change orders (PCCOs), and commitment change orders (CCOs) within the HB Report Financial Hub. This module enables project teams to monitor change exposure, track approval workflows, and analyze financial impact across all change-related activities.

## Key Features

### 1. Change Order Overview
- **KPI Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for approved, pending, and rejected change orders
- **Monthly Trends**: Visual tracking of change order submission and approval patterns
- **Category Breakdown**: Analysis by trade/category with pie chart visualization
- **Financial Impact**: Cumulative change order impact on project budget

### 2. Change Order Tracking
- **Interactive Table**: Detailed tracking of all change orders with status, amounts, and timelines
- **Status Management**: Visual status indicators (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by trade category for focused analysis
- **Impact Assessment**: Schedule and cost impact tracking

### 3. Risk Analysis
- **Value Distribution**: Change order values by approval status
- **Risk Assessment**: Multi-factor risk scoring for schedule, budget, and scope
- **Financial Impact**: Percentage of original budget analysis

### 4. **Exposure Analysis** (New Feature)
Advanced risk metrics for change orders and commitments, providing deep insights into contract change exposure.

## Exposure Analysis Components

### Owner vs Subcontractor Delta
Compares Total Approved Prime Contract Change Orders (PCCOs) with Total Executed Commitment Change Orders (CCOs):
- **Delta Calculation**: PCCO Total â€“ CCO Total
- **Risk Indicators**: 
  - ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk: <5% variance
  - ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk: 5-10% variance
  - ðŸ”´ High Risk: >10% variance
- **Purpose**: Identifies exposure gaps between owner approvals and subcontractor commitments

### Unapproved Exposure
Calculates potential financial exposure from unprocessed changes:
- **Total Identified Exposure**: Sum of Change Events + Pending PCOs
- **Unapproved Exposure**: Identified â€“ Approved PCCOs
- **Risk Thresholds**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Low: <$25,000
  - ðŸŸ¡ Medium: $25,000-$50,000
  - ðŸ”´ High: >$50,000

### Risk Scorecard
Key performance indicators for change management process:
- **% Change Dollars Pending**: Percentage of change value awaiting approval
- **Avg Days PCO to PCCO**: Processing time from submission to execution
- **% PCOs Unlinked to PCCO**: Process gap identification
- **Largest Open Exposure**: Single highest-risk unprocessed item

## Data Sources and Definitions

### Project Filtering
All data is filtered by `project_id: 2525840` (PALM BEACH LUXURY ESTATE) to ensure project-specific analysis.

### Data Sources (Mock JSON)
1. **change-events.json**: Identified change events with pricing
2. **pco.json**: Potential Change Orders submitted for approval
3. **pcco.json**: Prime Contract Change Orders (owner-approved changes)
4. **cco.json**: Commitment Change Orders (subcontractor-executed changes)

### Key Definitions

#### Change Events
Initial identification of potential changes with:
- `event_id`: Unique identifier
- `event_title`: Description of change
- `latest_price`: Current estimated cost
- `over_under_budget`: Budget impact

#### PCO (Potential Change Order)
Formal change request submitted for approval:
- `pco_number`: Unique PCO identifier
- `status`: Pending/Approved/Rejected
- `amount`: Requested change amount
- `change_reason`: Justification category

#### PCCO (Prime Contract Change Order)
Owner-approved change to prime contract:
- `pcco_number`: Unique PCCO identifier
- `status`: Approval status
- `executed`: Implementation status
- `amount`: Approved change amount

#### CCO (Commitment Change Order)
Subcontractor-executed change to commitments:
- `contract`: Related subcontract
- `contract_company`: Executing subcontractor
- `amount`: Executed change amount
- `status`: Execution status

## Calculation Methods

### Delta Analysis
```
Owner vs Subcontractor Delta = Total Approved PCCOs - Total Executed CCOs
Delta Percentage = (Delta / Total Executed CCOs) Ã— 100
```

### Exposure Analysis
```
Total Identified Exposure = Sum(Change Events) + Sum(Pending PCOs)
Unapproved Exposure = Total Identified Exposure - Sum(Approved PCCOs)
```

### Risk Metrics
```
% Change Dollars Pending = (Pending PCO Value / Total PCO Value) Ã— 100
Processing Time = Average days from PCO submission to PCCO execution
Unlinked Percentage = (Unlinked PCOs / Total PCOs) Ã— 100
```
