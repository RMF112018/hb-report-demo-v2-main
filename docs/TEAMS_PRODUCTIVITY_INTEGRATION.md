## Microsoft Graph API Integration

### Supported APIs

#### Teams API

- **Teams**: `/teams` - Team discovery and management
- **Members**: `/teams/{id}/members` - Member management and roles
- **Channels**: `/teams/{id}/channels` - Channel management

#### Planner API

- **Plans**: `/planner/plans` - Plan container management
- **Tasks**: `/planner/tasks` - Task CRUD operations
- **Assignments**: Task assignment to team members
- **Progress**: Task progress tracking and updates

#### Calendar API

- **Events**: `/calendar/events` - Event creation and management
- **Online Meetings**: Teams meeting integration
- **Attendees**: Meeting attendee management

### Authentication & Permissions

The integration requires the following Microsoft Graph permissions:

#### Delegated Permissions

- `Group.Read.All` - Read team information
- `Group.ReadWrite.All` - Manage team settings
- `Tasks.ReadWrite` - Manage Planner tasks
- `Calendars.ReadWrite` - Manage calendar events
- `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite` - Create Teams meetings

#### Application Permissions (for service scenarios)

- `Group.Read.All`
- `Tasks.Read.All`
- `Calendars.Read`

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Teams Selection**: User selects a team from available Microsoft 365 groups
2. **Context Loading**: System loads team members, channels, and plans
3. **Tab Navigation**: User switches between Messages, Tasks, Calendar, and Team tabs
4. **API Operations**: Components make authenticated calls to Microsoft Graph
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are reflected immediately in the UI

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback with retry mechanisms
- **Authentication**: Automatic token refresh and re-authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper handling of Graph API throttling
- **Data Validation**: Client-side validation before API calls

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on-demand
- **Caching**: Strategic caching of team and user data
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated appropriately
- **Debouncing**: Search and filter operations are debounced

## Integration Points

### Project Integration

The Teams productivity features integrate with HB Report Demo projects through:

1. **Project Team Mapping**: Automatic discovery of project-related teams
2. **Task Synchronization**: Project milestones can be synced with Planner tasks
3. **Calendar Integration**: Project deadlines appear in calendar views
4. **Team Collaboration**: Project stakeholders are automatically added to relevant teams

### Data Synchronization

- **Real-time Updates**: Changes propagate immediately across all users
- **Conflict Resolution**: Optimistic locking and conflict detection
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline capabilities with sync on reconnection

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Project Task

```typescript
// Example: Creating a task in the project team's plan
const taskData = {
  title: "Review structural drawings",
  description: "Complete review of Phase 1 structural drawings",
  dueDate: new Date("2024-02-15"),
  priority: 3, // High priority
  assigneeIds: ["user1@company.com", "user2@company.com"],
}

await createTask(planId, taskData)
```

### Scheduling a Project Meeting

```typescript
// Example: Creating a project review meeting
const meetingData = {
  subject: "Phase 1 Review Meeting",
  start: new Date("2024-02-10T10:00:00"),
  end: new Date("2024-02-10T11:00:00"),
  attendeeEmails: ["pm@company.com", "architect@company.com"],
  isOnlineMeeting: true,
}

await createEvent(meetingData)
```

### Managing Team Members

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new team member
const memberData = {
  email: "newmember@company.com",
  role: "member",
}

await addTeamMember(teamId, memberData)
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- Always validate user permissions before API calls
- Use minimal required permissions
- Implement proper error handling for authorization failures

### Performance

- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Minimize API calls through efficient data loading

### User Experience

- Provide clear loading states
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Offer offline capabilities for critical operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**

   - Verify app registration permissions
   - Check token expiration and refresh logic
   - Ensure proper scopes are requested

2. **API Rate Limiting**

   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Use batch operations where available
   - Monitor API usage patterns

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Verify webhook configurations
   - Check for proper event handling
   - Implement conflict resolution strategies

### Debug Tools

- Microsoft Graph Explorer for API testing
- Azure AD app registration portal
- Browser developer tools for network inspection
- Application Insights for monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Advanced Task Dependencies**: Gantt chart integration
- **Resource Management**: Team capacity planning
- **Advanced Analytics**: Productivity metrics and reporting
- **Mobile Support**: React Native components
- **Offline Sync**: Enhanced offline capabilities

### API Expansions
