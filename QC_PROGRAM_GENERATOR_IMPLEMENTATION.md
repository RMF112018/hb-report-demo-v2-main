```typescript
interface QCProgram {
  id: string
  projectId: string
  programName: string
  version: string
  status: "draft" | "review" | "approved" | "published" | "archived"
  aiGenerated: boolean
  aiConfidence: number

  // Program Content
  executiveSummary: string
  scopeOfWork: string[]
  qualityObjectives: string[]
  standards: QCStandard[]
  procedures: QCProcedure[]
  checkpoints: QCCheckpoint[]
  testing: QCTesting[]
  documentation: QCDocumentation[]

  // Milestone Integration
  milestones: ProjectMilestone[]
