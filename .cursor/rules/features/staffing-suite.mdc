# 🧠 Cursor Rules: Enhanced Staffing Suite (Executive, Project Executive, Project Manager)

---

## 🆕 Excel-Workflow Alignment Enhancements

### 📊 Assignment Table Enhancements
- Refactor the current assignment table to group data by:
  - 1️⃣ Project Executive
  - 2️⃣ Then by Project (under each PE group)
- Use expandable/collapsible group headers
- Within each project group, show staff assignments sorted by start date

---

### 🧩 “Needing Assignment” Panel
- Add a panel directly **below** the assignment table
- Title: `"Needing Assignment"`
- Filters:
  - Position (dropdown or segmented control)
- Logic:
  - Show all employees who:
    - Have a current assignment ending within **90 calendar days**
    - AND have **no follow-up assignment** scheduled
- Data Source: `staffing.json` assignment history
- Bonus: Color indicators for urgency (e.g. red = <30 days, yellow = <60)

---

## 🧱 GLOBAL LAYOUT EXPECTATIONS

- Light/Dark theme compliant (Tailwind tokens)
- All logic wired to `useStaffingStore.ts`
- Assignment + Needing Assignment panels live in same scrollable container
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for grouping/filters

## 🔁 Persist Filters & View
- Save selected position filter and panel open states to `localStorage`
- Restore on page reload

## 📦 MOCK DATA
- `staffing.json` for employee data + assignments
- `projects.json` to determine which Project Exec owns which project
