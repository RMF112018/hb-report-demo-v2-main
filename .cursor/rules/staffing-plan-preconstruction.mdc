description: >
  Ruleset for implementing a digital preconstruction staffing planning tool
  based on the legacy Excel workflow. The tool supports summary activity mapping,
  Gantt chart visualization, and monthly role allocation, with optional dynamic linkage
  to project schedule data.

inputs:
  - projects.json
  - staffing.json
  - schedule.json

rules:
  - id: activity-definition
    description: >
      Each summary activity must have a name, start date, and finish date.
      Activities may optionally link to an existing schedule activity via activityId.
    fields:
      - name: string (required)
      - startDate: date (required)
      - endDate: date (required)
      - linkedScheduleActivityId: string (optional)

  - id: timeline-rendering
    description: >
      The horizontal timeline grid is dynamically generated from project start to end date,
      as defined in projects.json. Months are shown as columns.

  - id: gantt-visualization
    description: >
      A Gantt chart must be rendered to visually represent the staffing activities over time.
      Each summary activity appears as a bar between its start and end date.
      The Gantt chart must update if activity dates are changed or linked schedule activities are updated.

  - id: staffing-matrix
    description: >
      A two-dimensional matrix (role x month) captures required staffing levels.
      Each cell contains an integer value â‰¥ 0 representing the number of FTEs needed for that role in that month.
    structure:
      - rows: pulled from staffing.json roles
      - columns: derived from month range of selected project

  - id: linkage-logic
    description: >
      If a summary activity is linked to a schedule.json activity, the start and end dates
      are auto-synced and dynamically updated if the source schedule changes.

  - id: validation
    description: >
      All FTE values must be numeric and non-negative. Duplicate position labels must be de-duplicated or aggregated.

  - id: output-format
    description: >
      The tool should be able to output the entire staffing plan as a JSON payload,
      with options to export to Excel or PDF for reporting purposes.

  - id: ui-integration
    description: >
      This tool must be accessible from the main staffing page via a new "Create" button.
      When clicked, it opens a popover with two options: "Staffing Plan" and "SPCR".
      "Staffing Plan" routes to the new planning tool. "SPCR" executes the original Create SPCR logic.
      The existing "Create SPCR" button must be removed. This Create button must appear only for users
      with roles 'project-executive' and 'project-manager'.

outputs:
  - JSON staffing plan payload
  - Excel export (xlsx)
  - PDF export

ui:
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
  - Responsive design with light and dark theme support
  - Activity editor and staffing grid with editable cells
  - Gantt chart for activity duration visualization
  - Create button with popover on staffing page for authorized users
