# constructability-review-center.mdc

## Overview

Refactor and expand the HB Intel platform’s constructability review workflow. This module is embedded into the **Project Control Center** under the `Pre-Construction > Pre-Construction` tab. It should feature a live dashboard, review log, review creation form, and downloadable report generator. Each review uses a stage-specific scorecard tied to a 1–10 scale and weighted category system.

---

## Features

### 1. Constructability Review Dashboard

- View live scores from current reviews per project.
- Filter by project stage, reviewer, or completion status.
- Include stage status indicator and weighted average score.

### 2. Constructability Review Log

- Historical list of all completed reviews.
- Table columns: project name, design stage, date, reviewer, overall score, report download.
- Grouped by design stage.

### 3. Review Creation Tool

- Trigger new review based on current project stage.
- Score 1–10 per review item.
- Scores are weighted by stage-specific ratios.
- Auto-calculate and display overall score.
- Save draft, submit final, or export PDF.

## Design Stages & Weighting Ratios

| Stage                 | Design Feas. | Coord/Complete | Compliance | Cost/Schedule | Constructability | BIM Review |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Schematic Design      | 35%          | 15%            | 20%        | 20%           | 10%              | —          |
| 50% Design Dev        | 25%          | 20%            | 15%        | 20%           | 15%              | 5%         |
| 100% Design Dev       | 15%          | 25%            | 20%        | 15%           | 15%              | 10%        |
| 80% Construction Docs | 10%          | 25%            | 20%        | 15%           | 15%              | 15%        |
| 100% Construction Doc | 5%           | 25%            | 20%        | 15%           | 15%              | 20%        |

## Grading Scale (1–10)

- **1–3:** Major issues, severe risks, incomplete or conflicting design.
- **4–6:** Average quality, minor gaps, some uncertainty.
- **7–8:** High-quality documents with few risks.
- **9–10:** Fully coordinated, code-compliant, and constructible documents.

## Review Item Templates

### Schematic Design (SD)

#### Design Feasibility

- Verify conceptual layouts align with project goals
- Assess feasibility of proposed building systems
- Confirm design supports intended use

#### Coordination and Completeness

- Check basic alignment between disciplines
- Verify inclusion of major project components

#### Compliance and Regulatory

- Assess compliance with zoning regulations
- Review environmental constraints

#### Cost and Schedule

- Evaluate design against initial budget
- Identify early value engineering opportunities
- Assess impact on preliminary schedule

#### Constructability and Safety

- Evaluate site access for construction
- Identify major constructability challenges
- Ensure design avoids obvious safety risks

---

### 50% Design Development (DD)

(Same review items as SD. See rationale for adjusted weightings.)

---

### 100% Design Development (DD)

#### Design Feasibility

- Confirm design supports functionality and aesthetics
- Assess feasibility of selected materials and systems

#### Coordination and Completeness

- Verify completeness of architectural and engineering drawings
- Check coordination between disciplines
- Confirm specifications outline major materials

#### Compliance and Regulatory

- Verify compliance with building codes
- Ensure accessibility requirements are met
- Assess environmental compliance

#### Cost and Schedule

- Review design alignment with updated budget
- Evaluate value engineering options
- Assess schedule impacts of design choices

#### Constructability and Safety

- Evaluate constructability of detailed designs
- Identify sequencing challenges
- Ensure safety in design implementation

#### BIM Team Review

- Verify BIM model accuracy for all major systems
- Check clash detection for preliminary conflicts
- Confirm BIM model includes specifications data
- Review BEP implementation and updates
- Assess model readiness for CD phase

(80% CD and 100% CD will follow same item structure, with increased BIM and execution emphasis.)

## Report Generator

- Export completed reviews as branded PDF report
- Include: project metadata, design stage, scores per category, item comments (if any), weighted calculation table, signature line
- Embed methodology and weighting table at end

---

## Mock Data

- Add `mock/preconstruction/reviewLog.json`
- Add `mock/preconstruction/reviewTemplates.json`

---

## Access + Visibility

- Only available to: Precon Manager, Estimator, Project Manager
- Route: `/projects/[project_id]/preconstruction/reviews`

---

## Integration Notes

- Use localStorage to track draft progress
- Scores stored in JSON structure:

```json
{
  "project_id": 123456,
  "stage": "100% DD",
  "date": "2025-07-10",
  "reviewer": "Jane Smith",
  "scores": {
    "Design Feasibility": 7.5,
    "Coordination and Completeness": 8,
    "Compliance and Regulatory": 8,
    "Cost and Schedule": 7,
    "Constructability and Safety": 7,
    "BIM Team Review": 8
  },
  "overall_score": 7.45
}
```

## Implementation Tips

- Use consistent table/grid UI components
- Visualize category weighting in side-by-side bar
- Offer keyboard input + slider for score entry
- Allow future filtering by stage, score range, reviewer
- Ensure report export is print-optimized
